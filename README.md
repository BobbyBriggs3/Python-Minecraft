A python-replica of the popular game minecraft with exploding tnt, real-world physics, textures, player movement, biomes, chunks, creative mode, fog and so much to explore.


Some file descriptions: 
    - textures: texture pngs that may or may not have been taken from the actual game #dontsue?
    - block.py: block properties
    - chunk.py: chunk properties
    - player.py: all player attributes 
    - world.py: generates the world
    
 
To use:
    1. make sure to have pygame, pyglet and other libraries downloaded 
    2. cd to directory 
    3. python3 ./main
    4. Hit 'e' to enter/exit the window, click to break, left click to build, try hitting x and then building! Some keys change what block you are holding. 

NOTES:
Have fun exploring, I'm sure you will find some cool features but be warned, this hits your CPU hard as it is not quite optimally integrated.
