Some file descriptions: <br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp; - textures: texture pngs that may or may not have been taken from the actual game #dontsue?<br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp; - block.py: block properties<br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp; - chunk.py: chunk properties<br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp; - player.py: all player attributes <br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp; - world.py: generates the world<br>
    
 
To use:<br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;  1. make sure to have pygame, pyglet and other libraries downloaded <br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;  2. cd to directory <br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;  3. python3 ./main <br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;  4. Hit 'e' to enter/exit the window, click to break, left click to build, try hitting x and then building! Some keys change what block you are holding.<br> 

NOTES:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Have fun exploring, I'm sure you will find some cool features but be warned, this hits your CPU hard as it is not quite optimally integrated.<br>
